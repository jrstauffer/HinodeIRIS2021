Supplemental Materials for Hinode 14/IRIS11 poster

Thanks for looking at my poster! In this repository, you can find several supplementary files:
acknowledgements.txt: acknowledgements for the many people who helped make this research possible
references.txt: a list of references and further reading
int_movie.mp4: a movie showing the core intensities of the four observed lines, in addition to the HMI continuum and magnetogram. Pay close attention for the "cold bubbles" as they appear around the edge of the pore!
